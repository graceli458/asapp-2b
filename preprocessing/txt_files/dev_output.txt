agent: Hi! How may I help? customer: I was told what a great company you are and how great your customer service is...  and was going to give you a try, but wow... talk about high priced agent: I see, what seems to be the issue with the price? customer: surely there is some mistake on the price of your Michael Kors shirt customer: 99$ agent: Was it a different price the day before? customer: honestly, is that why the shipping is free? customer: well, yeah, it was actually...  75 day before yesterday agent: I see, may I have your full name, order and account ID to verify the price? customer: Norman Bouchard customer: 0001154344 customer: 47BSOQMZX7 customer: normanb5 is user name,, if that matters agent: Thank you! One second. agent: I'm sorry to hear you have an issue with the price. Our algorithms change it on many different bases, such as season, demand, etc. I cannot fix the site's price. customer: well, can't you enter in a discount or a sale over-ride price? customer: we can do that in our system, and I have worked retail for years agent: I can't over-ride the price. As our algorithm cannot be changed. I can offer you a promo code however, to use on any future order. agent: OGUFP customer: and what will that do? agent: It will apply a discount at the time of any future purchase. You will have to apply it to find out how much, it will not work on jewelry, but that is all. customer: no, that is pretty lame, actually customer: surely someone there can do something, after all, you asked me about the price from yesterday agent: I asked about the price from yesterday because it is a common issue. However I cannot change it back to yesterday, there is nothing else I can do besides give a promo code that likely covers the extra cost anyway. agent: Very sorry for the issue, is there anything else I can help you with today? customer: no, and I will just not place the order.  It doesn't show ordered, correct? agent: Correct. You can just simply not order it, and the promo code can be used whenever you like within the next 7 days if you find something else you want. customer: so the promo code is usable even if I don't order the shirt? agent: Correct. customer: oh wow, well, I was just thinking what a crappy day...  thanks customer: i see the rainbow, lol customer: have a good one and thanks for the promo agent: No problem! I hope you get use from the code. Have a great day!

I will try that.  Thank you! agent: No worries. Is there anything else you need? customer: That is all for today agent: Then have a nice day!
