    "Like before, we can evaluate our model on the validation set. The perplexity is much lower than for the CLM objective because for the MLM objective, we only have to make predictions for the masked tokens (which represent 15% of the total here) while having access to the rest of the tokens. It's thus an easier task for the model."
